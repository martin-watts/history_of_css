  <p class="text-[24px] text-left">Browsers limiting styling options was deliberate - this is a quote from Marc Andreeseen, made in reply to a question about how to style menu tags in Mosaic:</p>
  <blockquote class="text-[2rem] w-full whitespace-pre-line" cite="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1994q1/0648.html">
    It's not a bug -- it's a rendering choice made by the browser...
    Mosaic is putting a blank line at the start of all toplevel lists,
    including yours, entirely on purpose. (Why? Primarily because we
    thought that looked the best for most documents on the Web at the
    time, as I remember.)

    What can you do about it? Probably nothing. Isn't that cheery news?
    I think so. In fact, it has been a constant source of delight for me
    over the past year to get to continually tell hordes (literally) of
    people who want to -- strap yourselves in, here it comes -- control
    what their documents look like in ways that would be trivial in TeX,
    Microsoft Word, and every other common text processing environment:
    "Sorry, you're screwed."
